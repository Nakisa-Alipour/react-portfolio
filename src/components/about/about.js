        <p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio! My name is Nakisa Alipour, 
            and I am a new full-stack developer with a Bachelor of Software Engineering, 
            an MBA, and experience in international finance. </p>

        <p>My passion for coding began several years ago when I first discovered the 
            thrill of creating something new using technology. Although I took a break 
            from coding to pursue my MBA and career in finance, I have recently returned 
            to my roots and dedicated myself to learning everything I can about full-stack 
            development. One of my greatest strengths is my ability to approach problems from 
            a creative perspective. I enjoy thinking outside the box and finding 
            unique solutions to complex challenges. Additionally, I am diligent 
            in my work and strive to produce high-quality code that meets the 
            needs of both the user and the business.</p>

        <p>I am excited to bring my skills and experience to a new team and 
            contribute to the development of innovative and user-friendly applications. 
            Thank you for taking the time to view my portfolio, and I look forward to 
            hearing from you soon!</p>
